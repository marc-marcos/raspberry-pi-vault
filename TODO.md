# TODO

## DOING
- Creating a frontend to be able to manage the repos.
  - In this frontend, be able to see how much free space there is in the raspberry pi.
  - Entering the repos tab shouldn't reload all the repos, there should be a button for that. Entering the repos tab should only list the repos that are available locally (so it runs faster). So I need a new function to be able to list the local files.

## TODO

- Scan certain Drive folders and download them.
- Scan ICloud.
- Use an external hard drive to store everything.

## BUGS

- [ ] When there is a repo that isn't mine it throws an error.
- [ ] When a Bitwarden password doesn't have a username it fails, it shouldn't.
- [ ] Some error with Gitlab repositoriers when storing them locally.
